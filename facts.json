It's crazy because it makes you realize a change in percussion can change the entire context of the song! Here's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbUYVcaF_l0' target='_blank'> one</a> of their videos - Megadeth's drummer forms his own sequence to Mr. Brightside." },

The end to end experience was something out of the future, and it was particularly cool to see the Waymo handle an edge case when the car in front was backing up in traffic. If it isn't already - this might be one of the Bay Area's most exciting attractions!"}
