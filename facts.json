This film might just take the spot of Home Alone as my go-to Christmas movie. Set in a 70s New England boarding school, it carries the same nostalgic charm as Dead Poets Society, blending comedy and poignancy effortlessly. With a sharp script and outstanding performances, The Holdovers lingered in my mind long after the credits rolled—definitely one to watch!"},

Could a similar approach apply to networking infrastructure? Defining slices based on traffic types, latency patterns, or cloud providers could help identify anomalies and trigger proactive actions using historical data. This could be a great inspiration for improving anomaly detection in networking!"},

    { "date": "Jan 26, 2025", "fact": "I found this awesome Youtube channel called <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@DrumeoOfficial' target='_blank'>Drumeo</a> - and they have a sequence of videos where famous drummers listen to pop songs (that they've likely not heard of) and form their own drum sequences. It's crazy because it makes you realize a change in percussion can change the entire context of the song! Here's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbUYVcaF_l0' target='_blank'> one</a> of their videos - Megadeth's drummer forms his own sequence to Mr. Brightside." },

The end to end experience was something out of the future, and it was particularly cool to see the Waymo handle an edge case when the car in front was backing up in traffic. If it isn't already - this might be one of the Bay Area's most exciting attractions!"}
